# ft_nm
#### ft_nm is a Unix-based command that aims to recreate the 'nm' command's functionality

- this program is used to examine the symbol table of binary files like object files, libraries, and executables
- that means it shows functions, global variables, constants.. etc found within the binary, along with their addresses, types, and visibility
- this utility is useful for debugging and analyzing the internal structure of programs

#### - bruh why would u ever recode this thing...
 - understanding binary internals + structure of ELF files + fundamental understanding how executables work
 - gaining skillz in diff security domains like reverse-engineering, exploit development, malware analysis and vulnerability analysis
 - getting familiar with Linux Documentation.. you would likely need to research man pages, technical specifications and source code from 1971
