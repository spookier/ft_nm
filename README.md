#### - bruh why would u ever code this thing...
> - good cybersecurity starting point for someone with basic understanding of C and low-level concepts
> - understanding binary internals, structure of ELF files, gaining valuable skills in diff security domains like reverse-engineering, exploit development, malware analysis, vulnerability analysis and pentesting
